# Privacy

Privacy is the ability to control your information. Specifically, when exercising the right of privacy you can decide **when** and **how** your information can be shared. These decisions can be modified at any time for any reason.

Privacy is widely considered to be a fundamental human right. Article 17 of the [UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) contains explicit privacy protections.

> No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation. - UN ICCPR, Article 17
